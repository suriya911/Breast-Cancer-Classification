# Breast Cancer Classification with Neural Network

This repository contains code for a simple Neural Network model to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign. The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.

## Files

- *breast_cancer.ipynb*: Jupyter notebook for data exploration and model training.
- *data.csv*: Dataset in CSV format.

## Usage

1. Open and run the Jupyter notebook breast_cancer.ipynb for data exploration and model training.
2. Modify the Neural Network model in the notebook as needed.
3. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

## Dataset
The dataset (data.csv) contains features extracted from breast biopsy samples.
